VersionGit

VersionGit is a tool for managing the version number of Python modules, removing
the need to update an embedded version string whenever a Git tag is made, and
providing sensible development version numbers too. It does this by storing a
single file in the source repo that reads the version from ``git describe`` or
``git archive`` keywords. At build time, this file is modified in the
distribution to contain a static version number to be used in preference to
this. This tool is inspired by versioneer_, but has a vastly reduced feature set
so that the code stored in each module is minimal.
